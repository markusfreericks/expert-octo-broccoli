# ZrutyTools

This is intended to become a JSON validation library, containing

 - a parser for a DSL that parses a psudo-english description of the contents of a JSON tree
 - a test tool that takes a JSON document, validates it against the DSL, and generates a report

The whole thing is a test project.
